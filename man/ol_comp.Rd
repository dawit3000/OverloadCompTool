\title{Calculate Overload Compensation for One Instructor}
\usage{
ol_comp(
  instructor_schedule,
  L = 4,
  U = 9,
  rate_per_cr = 2500/3,
  reg_load = 12,
  sort_order = c("desc", "asc")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{instructor_schedule}{A data frame of the instructor's courses, with columns \code{INSTRUCTOR}, \code{ENRLD}, and \code{HRS}.}

\item{L}{Lower enrollment threshold for overload pay qualification (default = 4).}

\item{U}{Upper limit of proration; courses with ENRLD > U get full-rate pay (default = 9).}

\item{rate_per_cr}{Base overload pay per credit hour (default = 2500/3).}

\item{reg_load}{Regular teaching load in credit hours (default = 12).}

\item{sort_order}{Order in which to prioritize courses when counting toward the regular load.
Options are "desc" (highest-enrollment courses first, default) or "asc" (lowest-enrollment first).}
}
\value{
A tibble with course-level compensation and a summary block, matching \code{ol_comp_summary()} format.
}
\description{
Computes prorated overload pay and qualified credit hours for a single instructor
based on course credit hours, enrollment, and institutional overload rules.
}
\details{
If \code{sort_order = "asc"}, the function still uses the highest-enrolled qualified courses
for compensation, but it reserves the lowest-enrolled qualified courses
(bottom of the list) toward the regular teaching load first. Compensation begins only after
\code{reg_load} credit hours are excluded from the bottom up â€” \emph{preserving low-enrollment classes
as part of the regular load} and prioritizing compensation for higher-enrolled courses.
