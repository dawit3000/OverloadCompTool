\title{Calculate Overload Compensation for One Instructor}
\usage{
ol_comp(
  instructor_schedule,
  L = 4,
  U = 9,
  reg_load = 12,
  rate_per_cr = 2500/3,
  strategy = c("favor_instructor", "favor_institution")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{instructor_schedule}{A data frame of the instructor's courses, with columns \code{INSTRUCTOR}, \code{ENRLD}, and \code{HRS}.}

\item{L}{Lower enrollment threshold for overload pay qualification (default = 4).}

\item{U}{Upper limit of proration; courses with ENRLD > U get full-rate pay (default = 9).}

\item{reg_load}{Regular teaching load in credit hours (default = 12).}

\item{rate_per_cr}{Overload pay rate per credit hour (default = 2500/3).}

\item{strategy}{Strategy for assigning courses toward the regular load.
If "favor_instructor", higher-enrollment courses are prioritized for compensation.
If "favor_institution", lower-enrollment qualified courses are assigned to the regular load first.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original schedule plus columns for QUALIFIED_CR, TYPE, AMOUNT, and ROW_AMOUNT.
}
\description{
Computes prorated overload pay and qualified credit hours for a single instructor
based on course credit hours, enrollment, and institutional overload rules.
}
\details{
If \code{strategy = "favor_institution"}, the function reserves the lowest-enrolled
qualified courses (bottom of the list) for the regular teaching load first.
Compensation begins only after \code{reg_load} credit hours are excluded from the bottom up â€”
preserving low-enrollment classes as part of the regular load and prioritizing
compensation for higher-enrolled courses.
