## 🔍 Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use the `OverloadCompTool` R package to calculate overload pay for instructors based on their course schedules.

You can analyze individual instructors or entire schedules to compute prorated compensation.

---

## 📥 Load Data

```r
schedule <- read.csv("Schedule.csv")
head(schedule)
```

---

## 👩‍🏫 Analyze One Instructor

```r
IS <- get_instructor_schedule("Anderson-Robinson, Nataysha", schedule)
calculate_overload_compensation(IS)
```

---

## 📊 Summarize All Instructors

```r
summarize_all_instructors(schedule)
```

---

## 📝 Explanation

* Courses with fewer than 4 students are excluded.
* Courses with 4–9 students are prorated.
* Courses with ≥10 students count fully.
* Only hours **above the regular 12-hour load** are paid.

---

## 💡 Notes

* Pay rate can be adjusted via `rate_per_cr`
* Default thresholds: L = 4, U = 9, regular load = 12
* Output is human-readable and ready for export
