## 🔍 Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use the `coat` R package to calculate overload compensation for instructors based on institutional course schedules and compensation policies.

The package supports both individual instructor analysis and full-schedule summaries, applying proration and eligibility rules based on enrollment and credit hours.

---

## 🏫 Load Schedule

```r
schedule <- read.csv("data-raw/schedule.csv")
```

---

## 👤 Get Schedule for One Instructor

```r
get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
```

---

## 💵 Calculate Overload Compensation for One Instructor

```r
IS <- get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
ol_comp(IS)  # Uses default institutional policy

# Custom policy example
ol_comp(IS, L = 4, U = 8, reg_load = 9, rate_per_cr = 5000 / 3)
```

---

## 👥 List Unique Instructors in the Schedule

```r
get_unique_instructors(schedule)
```

---

## 🔢 Summarize Overload Compensation for an Instructor by Index

```r
ol_comp_byindex(108, schedule_df = schedule)
ol_comp_byindex(108, schedule_df = schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500 / 3, reg_load = 12)
```

---

## 📋 Summarize All Instructors’ Overload Compensation

```r
ol_comp_summary(schedule)
ol_comp_summary(schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500 / 3, reg_load = 12)
```

## 📝 Explanation

The **COAT** package determines overload compensation using institutional rules based on:

* Enrollment (`ENRLD`)
* Credit hours (`HRS`)
* Regular teaching load (`reg_load`)
* Per-credit compensation rate (`rate_per_cr`)

### Key Concepts:

* **Default Proration Range**:

  * Lower Bound (`L`) = 4
  * Upper Bound (`U`) = 9
  * Courses with `ENRLD < L` → No pay
  * Courses with `L ≤ ENRLD ≤ U` → Prorated
  * Courses with `ENRLD > U` → Full pay

* **Regular Load (`reg_load`)**:
  Only credit hours beyond this are eligible for overload compensation (default = 12 credit hours).

* **Rate per Credit Hour (`rate_per_cr`)**:
  Default is `2500 / 3` (≈ 833.33), but this is adjustable to reflect your institution’s policy.

---

### Notes

* All thresholds and pay rates are user-adjustable via function arguments.
* Output is returned as a tidy, human-readable tibble, ready for reporting or export.
