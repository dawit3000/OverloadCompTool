## 🔍 Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use the `catool` R package to calculate overload compensation for college instructors based on institutional course schedules and policy rules.

The package supports both individual instructor analysis and full-schedule summaries, applying proration and eligibility rules based on enrollment and credit hour thresholds.

---

## 🏫 Load Schedule

```r
schedule <- read.csv("data-raw/schedule.csv")
```

---

## 👤 Get Schedule for One Instructor

```r
get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
```

---

## 💵 Calculate Overload Compensation for One Instructor

```r
IS <- get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
ol_comp(IS)  # Uses default institutional policy

# Custom policy example
ol_comp(IS, L = 4, U = 8, reg_load = 9, rate_per_cr = 5000 / 3)
```

---

## 👥 List Unique Instructors in the Schedule

```r
get_unique_instructors(schedule)
```

---

## 🔢 Summarize Overload Compensation by Index

```r
ol_comp_byindex(108, schedule_df = schedule)
ol_comp_byindex(108, schedule_df = schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500 / 3, reg_load = 12)
```

---

## 📋 Summarize All Instructors’ Overload Compensation

```r
ol_comp_summary(schedule)
ol_comp_summary(schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500 / 3, reg_load = 12)
```

---

## 📝 Explanation

The **catool** package calculates overload compensation using institutional rules that account for:

* **Enrollment** (`ENRLD`)
* **Credit hours** (`HRS`)
* **Regular teaching load** (`reg_load`)
* **Per-credit compensation rate** (`rate_per_cr`)

### Key Concepts

* **Default Proration Range:**

  * Lower Bound (`L`) = 4
  * Upper Bound (`U`) = 9
  * `ENRLD < L` → No pay
  * `L ≤ ENRLD ≤ U` → Prorated pay
  * `ENRLD > U` → Full pay (unprorated)

* **Regular Load (`reg_load`)**:

  * Only credit hours beyond this are eligible for overload pay (default = 12)

* **Rate per Credit Hour (`rate_per_cr`)**:

  * Default is `2500 / 3` (\~833.33), but user-customizable

---

### Notes

* All thresholds and rates are user-adjustable via function arguments.
* Output is returned as a tidy tibble, readable and export-ready.
