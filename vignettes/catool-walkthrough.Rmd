## 🔍 Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use the `catool` R package to calculate overload compensation for instructors based on institutional course schedules and compensation policies.

The package supports both individual instructor analysis and full-schedule summaries, applying proration and eligibility rules based on enrollment and credit hours.

---

## 🏫 Load Schedule

```{r}
# Replace with your actual file path
# Fallback example for demonstration
schedule <- data.frame(
  INSTRUCTOR = c("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", "Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", "Smith, John"),
  ENRLD = c(12, 7, 4),
  HRS = c(3, 3, 3),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

---

## 👤 Get Schedule for One Instructor

```{r}
get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
```

---

## 💵 Calculate Overload Compensation for One Instructor

```{r}
IS <- get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
ol_comp(IS)  # Default institutional policy

# Custom policy example
ol_comp(IS, L = 4, U = 8, reg_load = 9, rate_per_cr = 5000 / 3)
```

---

## 👥 List Unique Instructors in the Schedule

```{r}
get_unique_instructors(schedule)
```

---

## 🔢 Summarize Overload Compensation by Instructor Index

```{r}
ol_comp_byindex(1, schedule_df = schedule)
ol_comp_byindex(1, schedule_df = schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500 / 3, reg_load = 12)
```

---

## 📋 Summarize All Instructors’ Overload Compensation

```{r}
ol_comp_summary(schedule)
ol_comp_summary(schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500 / 3, reg_load = 12)
```

---

## 📝 Explanation

The **catool** package determines overload compensation using institutional rules based on:

* Enrollment (`ENRLD`)
* Credit hours (`HRS`)
* Regular teaching load (`reg_load`)
* Per-credit compensation rate (`rate_per_cr`)

### Key Concepts

* **Proration Range**:

  * Courses with `ENRLD < 4`: No compensation
  * `ENRLD` between `4` and `9`: Prorated pay
  * `ENRLD ≥ 10`: Full pay (no proration)

* **Regular Load (`reg_load`)**:
  Only credit hours beyond this are considered for overload compensation.

* **Rate per Credit Hour**:
  Default rate is `2500 / 3` (\~833.33), customizable by the user.

---

### Notes

* All thresholds and pay rates are user-adjustable.
* Output is returned as a tidy, readable tibble—ready for reporting or export.
