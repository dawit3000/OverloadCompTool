## Package purpose

The `catool` (Compensation Analysis Tool) R package calculates overload compensation for college instructors based on institutional policies, teaching loads, and enrollment thresholds. It identifies qualified credit hours, applies proration rules where applicable, and generates formatted summary tables suitable for reporting and payroll.

The tool promotes fairness, transparency, and reproducibility, replacing fragile spreadsheet processes with a robust R-based solution.

## Vignettes and documentation

Includes a comprehensive walkthrough vignette covering compensation logic, usage examples, and flexible support for individual and batch analysis:
