## Package purpose

It identifies qualified credit hours, applies proration logic when applicable, and generates spreadsheet-ready summary tables. The tool promotes fairness, transparency, and consistency while reducing manual administrative effort.

## Vignettes and documentation
Includes a walkthrough vignette explaining policy logic, usage examples, compensation rules, and both full-schedule and individual analysis.

* Console messages have been removed or made suppressible (per CRAN policy).  
* Global variable warnings (e.g., `COLLEGE`, `DEPARTMENT`) resolved via `globalVariables()`.  
* The `LICENSE` file has been removed, and the `DESCRIPTION` now correctly declares only `AGPL-3`.
