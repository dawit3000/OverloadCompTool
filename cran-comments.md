### Notes:

* The `LICENSE` file follows the standard AGPL-3 format and is correctly declared in the `DESCRIPTION`.
* Global variable bindings (`COLLEGE`, `DEPARTMENT`, `PROGRAM`) are used in tidyverse-style NSE expressions. These are acceptable or can be suppressed via `utils::globalVariables()`.
* The timestamp note (`unable to verify current time`) is benign and does not affect package functionality.
