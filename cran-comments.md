## Package purpose
The `coat` (Compensation Analysis Tool) package calculates overload compensation for college instructors based on institutional policies. It identifies credit hour overloads, applies enrollment-based proration, and generates clear, human-readable summary tables. The tool ensures fairness, consistency, and reduces administrative errors in faculty compensation.

## Submission notes
This is the first submission of the `coat` package to CRAN. All functions are documented and include examples. A walkthrough vignette is included.

## Reverse dependencies
This is a new package, so there are no reverse dependencies.
