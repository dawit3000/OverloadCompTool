Description: Calculates fair and transparent overload compensation for college instructors 
    based on institutional policies, regular teaching load, and student enrollment thresholds. 
    Pay is awarded only for qualified credit hours beyond the regular load and is prorated 
    when enrollments fall below institutional minimums. The package provides functions for 
    flexible filtering, policy customization, and clean, spreadsheet-ready summary output 
    suitable for audits, payroll, and administrative reporting.
