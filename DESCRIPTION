Description: Calculates equitable overload compensation for college instructors
    based on institutional policies, enrollment thresholds, and regular teaching load limits.
    Compensation is awarded only for credit hours that exceed the regular load and meet
    minimum enrollment criteria. When enrollment is below a specified threshold, pay is
    prorated accordingly. The package prioritizes compensation from high-enrollment courses,
    or optionally from low-enrollment courses for fairness, depending on user-defined strategy.
    Includes tools for flexible policy settings, instructor filtering, and produces
    clean, audit-ready summary tables suitable for payroll and administrative reporting.
