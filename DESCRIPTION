Description: Calculates fair and transparent overload compensation for college instructors
    based on institutional policies, regular teaching load limits, and student enrollment thresholds.
    Compensation is awarded only for qualified credit hours beyond the standard load and is prorated
    when enrollment falls below institutional minimums. The package offers functions for flexible
    filtering, policy customization, and produces clean, spreadsheet-ready summary output
    suitable for audits, payroll, and administrative reporting.
