And be sure to include this in your `DESCRIPTION` file:

```
License: AGPL-3
```

If you also want to include the full license text (as you've pasted), save it as a separate file in the root of your package named `COPYING`, but the above short form in `LICENSE` is what CRAN expects.

Let me know when you're ready to proceed with `cran-comments.md` or the package rebuild.
