Tool for analyzing faculty overload compensation...


The **Overload Compensation Analysis Tool** is an R package designed to calculate fair and transparent overload pay for college instructors. It works from a course schedule to identify credit hour overloads and compute prorated pay based on enrollment thresholds.

## üîß Features

- Automatically filters for qualified courses
- Calculates prorated overload pay
- Summarizes compensation per instructor
- Supports full-schedule batch summaries
- Output-ready for Excel or PDF formats

## üì¶ Installation

```r
# Install directly from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dawit3000/OverloadCompTool")
````

## üìÅ Sample Usage

```r
library(OverloadCompTool)

# Load your schedule data

schedule <- read.csv("Schedule.csv")

# Get one instructor's pay default

IS<-get_instructor_schedule("Torres, Adam", schedule)
calculate_overload_compensation(IS)

# Get one instructor's overload compensation based on the following institutional guidelines:
# - An instructor is eligible for overload pay if they teach credit hours (HRS) exceeding the regular load of 9 credit hours per semester.
# - Compensation is provided only if the class contributing to the qualifying credit hours has at least 3 students enrolled (ENRLD ‚â• 3).
# - Compensation is prorated if enrollment falls between 3 and 15 students (inclusive).
# - The compensation rate is $1,000.00 per credit hour.

IS<-get_instructor_schedule("Torres, Adam")
calculate_overload_compensation(IS, L = 3, U = 15, rate_per_cr = 1000, reg_load = 9)


# Summarize everyone
summarize_all_instructors(schedule)
summarize_all_instructors(schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500/3, reg_load = 12)

```

## üìÑ Inputs

* A data frame with at least these columns:

  * `INSTRUCTOR` (Name of Instructors)
  * `HRS` (Credit Hours)
  * `ENRLD` (Enrollment)

## üìä Output

A tidy data frame including:

* Overload Pay by Course
* Total Compensation (USD)
* Summary notes
* Look for the last few newly added columns
