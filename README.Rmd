**COAT** (Compensation Analysis Tool) is an R package designed to calculate fair and transparent overload pay for college instructors. It works with course schedule data to identify credit hour overloads and compute prorated compensation based on enrollment thresholds and pay rates.

---

## üîß Features

- Filters qualified credit hours based on institutional rules
- Calculates prorated overload pay per course
- Summarizes total compensation per instructor
- Supports full-schedule batch processing
- Output-ready for export to Excel or PDF

---

## üì¶ Installation

```r
# Install directly from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dawit3000/coat")
````

---

## üìÅ Sample Usage

```r
library(coat)

# Load schedule data
schedule <- read.csv("data-raw/schedule.csv")

# Get overload compensation for one instructor (default policy)
IS <- get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
ol_comp(IS)


Apply a custom institutional policy:

- Overload pay begins after 12 credit hours (reg_load = 12)
- Prorated pay for 4‚Äì9 students (inclusive)
- No pay if ENRLD ‚â§ 3
- Full (unprorated) pay if ENRLD ‚â• 10
- Pay rate: $2500/3 per credit hour

IS <- get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
ol_comp(IS, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500/3, reg_load = 12)

# Get compensation summaries for all instructors listed throughout the schedule
ol_comp_summary(schedule)
ol_comp_summary(schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500/3, reg_load = 12)

## üìÑ Input Requirements

A data frame with the following minimal number of columns:

* `INSTRUCTOR`: Instructor name
* `HRS`: Course credit hours
* `ENRLD`: Course enrollment count

---

## üìä Output

A tidy tibble that includes:

* Overload Pay by Course
* Total Compensation (USD)
* Summary notes (e.g., proration applied)

The final rows summarize total qualified credit hours and total overload pay.
