Tool for analyzing faculty overload compensation...


The **Overload Compensation Analysis Tool** is an R package designed to calculate fair and transparent overload pay for college instructors. It uses course schedule data (such as institutional dynamic course scheduling) to identify credit hour overloads and compute prorated compensation based on enrollment proration thresholds and the compensation rate per credit hour.


## üîß Features

- Automatically filters for qualified credit hours for compensation
- Calculates prorated overload pay
- Summarizes compensation per individual instructor
- Supports full-schedule batch summaries
- Output-ready for Excel or PDF formats

## üì¶ Installation

```r
# Install directly from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dawit3000/OverloadCompTool")
````

## üìÅ Sample Usage

```r
library(OverloadCompTool)

# Load your schedule data

schedule <- read.csv("data-raw/schedule.csv")

# Get one instructor's pay default

IS<-get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha", schedule)
calculate_overload_compensation(IS)

# Get one instructor's overload compensation based on the following institutional guidelines:
# - An instructor is eligible for overload pay if they teach credit hours (HRS) exceeding the regular load of 9 credit hours per semester.
# - Compensation is provided only if the class contributing to the qualifying credit hours has at least 3 students enrolled (ENRLD ‚â• 3).
# - Compensation is prorated if enrollment falls between 3 and 15 students (inclusive).
# - The compensation rate is $1,000.00 per credit hour.

IS<-get_instructor_schedule("Lalau-Hitchcock, Diksha")
calculate_overload_compensation(IS, L = 3, U = 15, rate_per_cr = 1000, reg_load = 9)


# Summarize everyone
summarize_all_instructors(schedule)
summarize_all_instructors(schedule, L = 4, U = 9, rate_per_cr = 2500/3, reg_load = 12)

```

## üìÑ Inputs

* A data frame with at least these columns:

  * `INSTRUCTOR` (Name of Instructors)
  * `HRS` (Credit Hours)
  * `ENRLD` (Enrollment)

## üìä Output

A tidy data frame including:

* Overload Pay by Course
* Total Compensation (USD)
* Summary notes
  * Look for the last few newly added columns
